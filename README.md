# Loan-Approval-Machine-Learning-Project
The approval of loans is an immensely tedious procedure because of the growing demand for loans. In addition, each applicantâ€™s credentials must be thoroughly processed before arriving at the conclusion of approving the loan or not. However, this process is inevitable, so the banking sector could take advantage of the current technological breakthroughs to be more effective and save time. This could be done by implementing a machine learning model on a dataset consisting of a group of applicants to predict whether they are eligible for a loan.
